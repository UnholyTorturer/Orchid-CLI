# Orchid-CLI
Orchid CLI is an attempt to write a command line interface for the M5Stack Cardputer. Orchid is written in MicroPython, using the version 1.22.2 firmware. Orchid is currently a work in progress, and as such, may not be entirely functional. The only way to know is to give it a try! I am open to suggestions or comments of any kind, just hit me up in the Cardputer Discord (T.J.).
